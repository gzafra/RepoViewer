I have decided to leave the LaunchScreen storyboard to allow for automatic screen size detection instead of adding Default launch images.

I have also decided towards the use of Helpers for Request and Cache as it keeps it simpler. A more complex logic would require to implement an instanced manager to handle and keep the state of the data as well as the cache.

Finally, some tests have been added but more would be needed and it would need to be split into different files.
